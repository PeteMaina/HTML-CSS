            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Feathery Friends Farm is a family-owned and operated farm dedicated to providing our community with fresh, high-quality eggs and happy, healthy chickens. We started our journey 3 years ago with a small flock of hens and a passion for sustainable agriculture. Since then, our farm has grown, but our commitment to quality and animal welfare remains at the heart of everything we do.</p>

            <p>We believe that happy hens lay the best eggs. That's why we raise our chickens in a humane and stress-free environment, allowing them to roam freely in our spacious pastures. We feed them a nutritious diet of grains, vegetables, and fresh herbs, ensuring they get all the essential vitamins and minerals they need to produce delicious and healthy eggs.</p>
